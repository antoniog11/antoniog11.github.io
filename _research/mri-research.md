Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging is an elastography method developed for ultrasound imaging that maps

Measuring ultrasound with MRI is so cool. It requires programming, hardware, RF. So many things. I really feel like my calling is that but I am scared that I wont be commited even there. What if its too hard to learn? What if I cant pick it up. I did basically teach myself how MRI works on my own. With resources and with my own studying of topics like fourier transform and other shit.
